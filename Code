Activity - Two-Player Game of Life
To call Conway's Game of Life a game is to stretch the meaning of the word "game", but there is an fun adaptation that can produce a competitive and strategic activity for multiple players.

The modification made is that now the live cells come in two colors (one associated with each player). When a new cell comes to life, the cell takes on the color of the majority of its neighbors. (Since there must be three neighbors in order for a cell to come to life, there cannot be a tie. There must be a majority)

Players alternate turns. On a player's turn, he or she must kill one enemy cell and must change one empty cell to a cell of their own color. They are allowed to create a new cell at the location in which they killed an enemy cell.

After a player's turn, the Life cells go through one generation, and the play moves to the next player. There is always exactly one generation of evolution between separate players' actions.

The initial board configuration should be decided beforehand and be symmetric. A player is eliminated when they have no cells remaining of their color.

This variant of life can well be adapted to multiple players. However, with more than two players, it is possible that a newborn cell will have three neighbors belonging to three separate players. In that case, the newborn cell is neutral, and does not belong to anyone.
